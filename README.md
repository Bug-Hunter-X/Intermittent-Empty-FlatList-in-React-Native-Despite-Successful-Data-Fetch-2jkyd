# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList renders an empty list despite successfully fetching data from an API. The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably. The network request appears successful, yet the FlatList remains empty with no error messages in the console.

## Bug Description

A React Native application fetches data from an API using `fetch`.  The API returns valid JSON data. However, the `FlatList` component sometimes fails to render the fetched data, displaying an empty list instead.  There are no apparent errors in the console.  This behavior appears randomly and is not consistent.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe that the FlatList sometimes displays the data, and sometimes doesn't, even though the API returns the same data consistently.

## Solution
The solution involves using a unique `keyExtractor` function within FlatList and a more robust error-handling mechanism. A solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
